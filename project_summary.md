A CLIENT- SERVER ARCHITECTURE

In this project i demonstrated the power of Client-Server communication. For this project i created two Aws Ec2_instances of Ubuntu version 20.04 
distribution with all the configurations for free tier set up. I named one of the ec2 instance Db-server while the other EC2 instance I named the client.
